	* defaults to searching the present collection (rather than all collections)
	* remembers search context when viewing individual search results
	* provides multiple searchable fields depending on the collection being searched

3. Embeds the Internet Archive interactive book reader when a ContentDM item page provides a link to a book hosted on archive.org.

4. Allows you to define and upload custom menus for selected Collections (for example, Collections we host for AlabamaMosaic).
