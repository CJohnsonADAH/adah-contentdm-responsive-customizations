ADAH ContentDM Customizations for Responsive Website
====================================================

To Install
----------
* Upload `adah-responsive-contentdm.css` as Custom CSS

* Upload `adah-responsive-contentdm.js` as Custom JS

* Upload the contents of `/assets/js`, `/assets/css` and `/assets/html` as Custom Pages, using the same directory structure.

Customizations Provided
-----------------------
1. 	A highly customized Advanced Search Form, which:
	* appears in a pop-up modal
	* defaults to searching the present collection (rather than all collections)
	* remembers search context when viewing individual search results
	* provides multiple searchable fields depending on the collection being searched

2. Embeds streaming viewers for common video hosting services like Youtube and Vimeo when a ContentDM item provides a link to the video.

3. Embeds the Internet Archive interactive book reader when a ContentDM item page provides a link to a book hosted on archive.org.

4. Allows you to define and upload custom menus for selected Collections (for example, Collections we host for AlabamaMosaic).

5. Always displays breadcrumbs to the current page.

6. Displays the ContentDM menu as a horizontal menu bar rather than wrapped up into a hamburger menu when feasible.

7. Displays explicit text labels for Download, Print, and View action buttons for displayed items.
